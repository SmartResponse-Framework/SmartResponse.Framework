### About Command Output

For *displaying information to a user*, use `Write-Host` or, preferably, `Write-Verbose`. Never use `Write-Output` in any situation, unless there is a very specific reason to do so.

Use of `Write-Host` has been a controversial topic, in particular because of the limitations in doing anything with the output (redirect to `stdout`, etc) and confusion around what goes into the PowerShell pipeline. For the purposes of conveying information, we do **not** want that text getting into the pipeline.

Starting in Windows PowerShell 5.0, `Write-Host` is a wrapper for `Write-Information`, which is a structured information stream and can therefore can be used to transmit structured data between a script and its callers. This makes `Write-Host` useful for console messages without losing redirection functionality, and most importantly will not interfere with the PowerShell pipeline.

Example of redirecting `Write-Host`

```powershell
PS> Write-Host "Somebody said today that Iâ€™m lazy. I nearly answered him." 6> c:\tmp\out.txt
```
